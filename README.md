# California-Housing-using-TFDV

This repository contains an IPython notebook showcasing comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), outlier handling, missing value imputation, and data visualization using TensorFlow Data Validation (TFDV). Additionally, it covers encoding techniques and model building with varying learning rates across three different optimizers: Adam, RMSprop, and DNN. The evaluation includes assessing losses using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE), ultimately culminating in the selection of the optimal model based on loss and accuracy metrics.
